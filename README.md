In this project:

- I created a React App which utilizes an API to populate front-facing components
- I practiced receiving image urls using fetch and displaying them on the screen
- I successfully refactored the fetching process for the sake of speed of the application
- I practiced using useEffect and useState
- I raised up props into the parent component to be utilized my multiple child components
